Steps:
Import digits data set from Scikitlearn datasets library. Use load_digits(). When loaded, the dataset comes with data and target values.
Assign data to X and target to y
Check the shape of the data
Use np.bincount to print the number of uniqe elements of the target vriable y
Split data into train and test datasets. Use stratification when splitting. You can set your random_state to 42
Normalize your dataset. When normalizing, simply divide your dataset by the maximum of the train dataset. To find the maximum, use `max(
